# ROCKPAPERSCISSORS
This is a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game developed as a console application. The game allows a player to compete against the computer in a series of rounds. The player can choose "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors," while the computer randomly selects its move. The game then determines the winner based on the traditional rules: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cut Paper, and Paper covers Rock. The console displays the choices and the result of each round, keeping track of the score. The game is easy to play, with simple text-based commands, and provides a fun way to enjoy the timeless Rock-Paper-Scissors challenge!
